# Restaurant WebApp
This is a web application that allows customers to place orders and restaurant staff to manage those orders. Customers can scan a unique QR code to identify their table and view the menu items. They can then add items to their cart and place their order. Restaurant staff can view and manage the orders, mark them as complete, and assign waiters to tables.
